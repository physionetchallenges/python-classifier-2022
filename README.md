# Python example classifier code for the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022

## What's in this repository?

This repository contains a simple example to illustrate how to format a Python entry for the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022. You can try it by running the following commands on the Challenge training sets. These commands should take a few minutes or less to run from start to finish on a recent personal computer.

For this example, we implemented a random forest classifier with several features. You can use a different classifier, features, and libraries for your entry. This simpple example is designed **not** not to perform well, so you should **not** use it as a baseline for your model's performance.

This code uses four main scripts, described below, to train and run a model for the 2022 Challenge.

## How do I run these scripts?

You can install the dependencies for these scripts by creating a Docker image (see below) and running

    pip install requirements.txt

You can train your model by running

    python train_model.py training_data model

where

- `training_data` (input; required) is a folder with the training data files and
- `model` (input; required) is a folder for saving your model.

You can run your trained model by running

    python run_model.py model test_data test_outputs

where

- `model` (input; required) is a folder for loading your model, and
- `test_data` (input; required) is a folder with the validation or test data files (you can use the training data for debugging and cross-validation), and
- `test_outputs` is a folder for saving your model outputs.

The [2022 Challenge website](https://physionetchallenges.org/2022/#data) provides a training database with a description of the contents and structure of the data files.

You can evaluate your model by pulling or downloading the [evaluation code](https://github.com/physionetchallenges/evaluation-2022) and running

    python evaluate_model.py labels outputs scores.csv class_scores.csv

where `labels` is a folder with labels for the data, such as the training database on the PhysioNet webpage; `outputs` is a folder containing files with your model's outputs for the data; `scores.csv` (optional) is a collection of scores for your model; and `class_scores.csv` (optional) is a collection of per-class scores for your model.

## Which scripts I can edit?

We will run the `train_model.py` and `run_model.py` scripts to train and run your model, so please check these scripts and the functions that they call.

Please edit the following script to add your training and testing code:

- `team_code.py` is a script with functions for training and running your model.

Please do **not** edit the following scripts. We will use the unedited versions of these scripts when running your code:

- `train_model.py` is a script for training your model.
- `run_model.py` is a script for running your trained model.
- `helper_code.py` is a script with helper functions that we used for our code. You are welcome to use them in your code.

These scripts must remain in the root path of your repository, but you can put other scripts and other files elsewhere in your repository.

## How do I train, save, load, and run my model?

To train and save your models, please edit the `train_challenge_model` function in the `team_code.py` script. Please do not edit the input or output arguments of the `train_challenge_model` function.

To load and run your trained model, please edit the `load_challenge_model` and `run_challenge_model` functions in the `team_code.py` script. Please do not edit the input or output arguments of the functions of the `load_challenge_model` and `run_challenge_model` functions.

## How do I run these scripts in Docker?

Docker and similar platforms allow you to containerize and package your code with specific dependencies so that you can run your code reliably in other computing environments and operating systems.

To guarantee that we can run your code, please [install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) Docker, build a Docker image from your code, and run it on the training data. To quickly check your code for bugs, you may want to run it on a small subset of the training data.

If you have trouble running your code, then please try the follow steps to run the example code.

1. Create a folder `example` in your home directory with several subfolders.

        user@computer:~$ cd ~/
        user@computer:~$ mkdir example
        user@computer:~$ cd example
        user@computer:~/example$ mkdir training_data test_data model test_outputs

2. Download the training data from the [Challenge website](https://physionetchallenges.org/2022). Put some of the training data in `training_data` and `test_data`. You can use some of the training data to check your code (and should perform cross-validation on the training data to evaluate your algorithm).

3. Download or clone this repository in your terminal.

        user@computer:~/example$ git clone https://github.com/physionetchallenges/python-classifier-2022.git

4. Build a Docker image and run the example code in your terminal.

        user@computer:~/example$ ls
        model  python-classifier-2022  test_data  test_outputs  training_data

        user@computer:~/example$ cd python-classifier-2022/

        user@computer:~/example/python-classifier-2022$ docker build -t image .
